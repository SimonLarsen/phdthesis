First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor Jan Baumbach for his guidance and support. I would have never gotten into bioinformatics, if not for his contagious enthusiasm and the many opportunities he provided me with.
%, first as a master's student and then as a PhD student.
It has been a great pleasure working together these past four years, both academically and personally.\\[1em]
I would also like to thank Trey Ideker for the great advice and discussions during the five months I spent in his group at UCSD. Thank you to Daniel Carlin for his valuable input and feedback and thank you to the entire Ideker Lab for making my stay pleasant and inspiring.\\[1em]
Thank you to Silvia Rogatto and Luisa do Canto for the collaboration on structural variants, to Harald Schmidt for the valuable feedback on my work, and to all other the collaborators I had the privilege of working with.\\[1em]
I am grateful for all the wonderful colleagues I have had in the computational biology group. Thank you to Richard, Nicolas, Christian, Jesper, Tobias, Alexander, Maria, Philipp, Weilong, Afsaneh, and many more, for all the interesting discussions and for making the lab an enjoyable place to work.\\[1em]
To my significant other, Manja, thank you for supporting me through everything. Your love and encouragement has made this PhD so much easier.\\[1em]
Last but not least, I want to thank my family: my parents and my sister for the love and support throughout my life. You have always inspired me to do my best, and I will keep doing what I can to make you proud.
