This is the LaTeX source for my PhD thesis which was completed at the University of Southern Denmark in August 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jan Baumbach.

The document uses the `memoir` document class. The bibliography is processed with BibLaTeX.

The final PDF compiled with LuaTeX is available here: https://github.com/SimonLarsen/phdthesis/releases/download/v1.0/thesis.pdf.
